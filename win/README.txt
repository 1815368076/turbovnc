There are two programs here:

    vncviewer - this is the VNC viewer, or client, program for Win32.

    putty - an open-source SSH client, which is bundled with vncviewer to
            simplify making secure connections to TurboVNC servers

See BUILDING.txt for instructions on how to build these programs.
