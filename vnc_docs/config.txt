| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_ALRALL = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable automatic lossless refresh for regions that were \
drawn using methods other than ''X[Shm]PutImage()'' |
| Platforms | Unix |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Section ": ALR}

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_CUCOPYAREA = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable continuous updates for large regions drawn using \
''XCopyArea()'' |
| Platforms | Unix |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: Normally, when the continuous updates feature is enabled,
	continuous updates are only sent for image regions drawn using
	''X[Shm]PutImage()''.  When ''TVNC_CUCOPYAREA'' is set to ''1'', continuous
	updates are also sent for regions drawn using ''XCopyArea()''.  This may be
	necessary in order to make the continuous updates feature work properly with
	some applications.  ''man -M /opt/TurboVNC/man vncviewer'' for more
	information about the continuous updates feature.

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_MT = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/Enable multithreaded image encoding |
| Platforms | Unix |

#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Chapter ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | ''VGL_NTHREADS = ''__''{n}''__ |
| Summary | Use __''{n}''__ threads to perform image encoding |
| Platforms | Unix |
| Default Value | __''{n}''__ = the number of CPU cores in the system |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: See {ref prefix="Chapter ": Multithreading}

| Environment Variable | ''TVNC_PROFILE = ''__''0 \| 1''__ |
| Summary | Disable/enable profiling output |
| Platforms | Unix |
| Default Value | Disabled |
#OPT: hiCol=first

	Description :: If profiling output is enabled, then the TurboVNC Server will
	continuously benchmark itself and periodically print the throughput of
	various stages in its image pipeline to the Xvnc log file.
