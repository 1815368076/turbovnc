** Starting and Connecting to a TurboVNC Session

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. __Mac clients:__ Start the Mac X11 application.

	#. Open a new Command Prompt/terminal window on your client machine.
		(__Mac clients:__ in the X11 application, start a new xterm [Command-N] if
		one isn't already started.)

	#. In the new Command Prompt/terminal/xterm window, open a Secure Shell (SSh)
		session into the TurboVNC server:

		Linux/Mac/Solaris clients :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		ssh {user}@{server}
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		#Verb: <<---
		"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace __''{user}''__ with your user account name on the TurboVNC server and
		__''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that server.

	#. In the SSh session, start a TurboVNC session:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver
		---

	#. Make a note of the X display number that the TurboVNC session is
		occupying, for instance:
		{nl}{nl}
		''New 'X' desktop is my_server:1''
		{nl}{nl}
		If this is the first time that a TurboVNC session has ever been run
		under this user account, TurboVNC will prompt for a VNC session password.

	#. The SSh session can now be exited, if desired.

	#. On the client machine, start the TurboVNC viewer.

		Linux/Mac/Solaris clients :: {:}
		Open a new terminal/xterm and type
		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncviewer
		---

		Windows clients :: {:}
		Select __TurboVNC Viewer__ in the __TurboVNC__ Start Menu group.

	#. A small dialog box will appear.
		{nl}{nl}
		|| Windows TurboVNC viewer || Linux/Mac/Solaris TurboVNC viewer ||
		| {img:turbovnc1.png} | {img:turbovnc2.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the X display name (hostname/IP address and display number) of the
		TurboVNC session in the "VNC Server" field, then click "Connect" (Windows)
		or press Enter (Linux/Mac/Solaris.)

	#. Another dialog box appears, prompting for the VNC session password.
		{nl}{nl}
		|| Windows TurboVNC viewer || Linux/Mac/Solaris TurboVNC viewer ||
		| {img:turbovnc3.png} | {img:turbovnc4.png} |
		{nl}
		Enter the VNC session password and click "OK" (Windows) or press
		Enter (Linux/Mac/Solaris.)
		{nl}{nl}
		A TurboVNC desktop window should appear on your client machine.  This
		window contains a virtual X server with which you can interact to launch
		X-Windows applications on the TurboVNC server.

** Disconnecting and Killing a TurboVNC Session

Closing the TurboVNC viewer disconnects from the TurboVNC session, but the
TurboVNC session will remain running on the TurboVNC server (as will any
applications that you may have started in the session), and you can reconnect
to the session at any time.

To kill a TurboVNC session:

	#. Using SSh (''c:\\Program Files\\TurboVNC\\putty.exe'' on Windows clients),
		log into the server that is running the TurboVNC session that you wish to
		kill.{nl} \
		... or ...{nl} \
		Using the TurboVNC viewer, connect to the TurboVNC session that you wish to
		kill, and open a new terminal in that TurboVNC session.

	#. Type the following command:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -kill :{n}
		---

	Replace __''{n}''__ with the X display number of the TurboVNC session you
	wish to kill.

To list the X display numbers and process ID's of all TurboVNC sessions that
are currently running under your user account on a particular machine, type the
following command:

	#Verb: <<---
	/opt/TurboVNC/bin/vncserver -list
	---

** Using TurboVNC in a Web Browser

When a TurboVNC session is created, it automatically launches a miniature web
server that serves up a Java TurboVNC viewer applet.  This Java TurboVNC viewer
can be used to connect to the TurboVNC session from a machine that does not
have a native TurboVNC viewer installed (or a machine for which no native
TurboVNC viewer is available.)  The Java viewer is significantly slower than
the native viewer on high-speed networks, but on low-speed networks the Java
viewer and native viewers have comparable performance.  The Java viewer does
not currently support double buffering.

To use the Java TurboVNC viewer, point your web browser to:

''http://''__''{turbovnc_server}''__'':{5800+''__''n''__''}''

where __''{turbovnc_server}''__ is the hostname or IP address of the TurboVNC
server, and __''n''__ is the X display number of the TurboVNC session to which
you want to connect.

__Example:__
If the TurboVNC session is occupying X display ''my_server:1'', then point your
web browser to:

''http://my_server:5801''

** Optimizing TurboVNC's Performance for Different Network Types

The level of image compression in TurboVNC can be adjusted to balance the
(sometimes conflicting) goals of high image quality and high performance.
There are four options which control the manner in which TurboVNC compresses
images:

	Allow JPEG compression :: {:}
		If this option is enabled, then TurboVNC will use JPEG compression for all
		image tiles with more than 24 unique colors and paletted encoding for all
		other image tiles.  If this option is disabled, then TurboVNC will select
		between paletted or raw encoding depending on the size of the image tile
		and its color count.

	JPEG image quality :: {:}
		Lower quality levels produce grainier JPEG images with more noticeable
		compression artifacts, but lower quality levels also use less network
		bandwidth and CPU time.

	JPEG chrominance subsampling :: {:}
		After converting the image from RGB to YUV, chrominance subsampling
		discards some of the U and V (chrominance) components to save space.  1x
		subsampling retains the chrominance components for all pixels, 2x
		subsampling retains the chrominance components for every other pixel, 4x
		subsampling retains the chrominance components for every fourth pixel, and
		grayscale throws out all of the chrominance components.  1x subsampling
		uses the most network bandwidth and CPU time, whereas grayscale uses the
		least.

	Zlib compression level :: {:}
		If Zlib compression is enabled, then paletted and raw-encoded image tiles
		will be compressed with Zlib prior to transmission.  This decreases network
		bandwidth usage at the expense of increased server CPU usage.  If JPEG
		compression is enabled, then Zlib compression is always used with non-JPEG
		image tiles.

In the Windows TurboVNC viewer, these parameters can be adjusted by accessing
the Options dialog box (click on the "Options" button in the "TurboVNC
Connection" dialog box or, after connecting to the server, click on the
Connection Options button in the toolbar.)  In the Unix TurboVNC viewer, press
F8 after connecting to bring up the options menu.  In the Java viewer, click on
the Options button at the top of the browser window.

The TurboVNC viewer provides five image encoding protocols, corresponding
to the most useful combinations of the image compression options described
above:

|| Image encoding protocol || Allow JPEG || JPEG image quality || \
	JPEG chrominance subsampling || Zlib compression level || Notes ||
| "Tight + Perceptually Lossless JPEG" | Yes | 95 | 1x | N/A | \
	This protocol should be perceptually lossless (that is, any image \
	compression artifacts it produces should be imperceptible to the human \
	eye under most viewing conditions.)  This protocol requires a great deal \
	of network bandwidth, however, and is generally not recommended except on \
	50 Megabit/second and faster networks. |
| "Tight + Medium Quality JPEG" | Yes | 80 | 2x | N/A | \
	For image tiles with a high number of unique colors, this protocol produces \
	some minor, but generally not very noticeable, image compression artifacts. \
	All else being equal, this protocol typically uses about twice the network \
	bandwidth of the "Low Quality JPEG" protocol and about half the bandwidth of the \
	"Perceptually Lossless JPEG" protocol, making it appropriate for medium-speed \
	networks such as 10 Megabit ethernet. |
| "Tight + Low Quality JPEG" | Yes | 30 | 4x | N/A | \
	For image tiles with a high number of unique colors, this protocol produces \
	very noticeable image compression artifacts.  However, it performs \
	optimally on low-bandwidth connections.  If image quality is more critical \
	than performance, then use one of the other connection protocols or take \
	advantage of the "Lossless Refresh" feature. |
| "Lossless Tight" | No | N/A | N/A | 0 | \
	This protocol uses paletted encoding for image tiles with a low number of \
	unique colors but otherwise does not perform any image compression at all. \
	It is thus suitable only for gigabit and faster networks.  This protocol \
	uses significantly less CPU time than any of the JPEG-based protocols. |
| "Lossless Tight + Zlib" | No | N/A | N/A | 1 | \
	This protocol uses paletted encoding for image tiles with a low number of \
	unique colors and raw encoding for image tiles with a high number of unique \
	colors.  It compresses all image tiles using Zlib with compression level \
	1.  For certain types of applications (CAD applications, in particular), \
	this protocol uses less network bandwidth than the "Perceptually Lossless JPEG" \
	protocol, but it also uses significantly more CPU time on the server than \
	any of the JPEG-based protocols. |

In the Windows TurboVNC viewer, the image encoding protocol can be set using
the Options dialog box (click on the "Options" button in the "TurboVNC
Connection" dialog box or, after connecting to the server, click on the
Connection Options button in the toolbar.)  In the Java viewer, the same thing
is accomplished by clicking on the "Options" button at the top of the browser
window.  With the Linux/Mac/Solaris TurboVNC viewer, the "Perceptually
Lossless" protocol is the default, and you can use the following command line
switches to select another protocol:

''-medqual'' = select the "Tight + Medium Quality JPEG" protocol {nl}
''-lowqual'' = select the "Tight + Low Quality JPEG" protocol {nl}
''-lossless'' = select the "Lossless Tight" protocol {nl}
''-losslesswan'' = select the "Lossless Tight + Zlib" protocol {nl}

You can also press the F8 key after connecting to pop up a menu from which you
can select a different protocol.

*** Lossless Refresh

Since both of TurboVNC's mathematically lossless protocols have performance
drawbacks, another option for image-quality-critical applications is the
"Lossless Refresh" feature.  When a lossless refresh is requested by a TurboVNC
viewer, the server will send a mathematically lossless image of the current
TurboVNC desktop to the requesting viewer.  So, for instance, a user can
rotate/pan/zoom an object in their 3D application using a very low-quality JPEG
setting, then when that user is ready to interpret or analyze the object, they
can request a lossless refresh of TurboVNC's virtual screen.

To perform a lossless refresh in the Windows or Unix TurboVNC viewers, press
CTRL-ALT-SHIFT-L (in the Windows TurboVNC viewer, you can also click on the
Lossless Refresh toolbar icon.)  In the Java TurboVNC viewer, click on the
"Lossless Refresh" button at the top of the browser window.

** Securing a TurboVNC Connection

Normally, the connection between the TurboVNC server and the TurboVNC viewer is
completely unencrypted, but securing that connection can be easily
accomplished by using the port forwarding feature of Secure Shell (SSh.)  After
you have started a TurboVNC session on the TurboVNC server, open a new SSh
connection into the TurboVNC server using the following command line:

	Linux/Mac/Solaris clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L {5900+n}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	---

	Windows clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" -L {5900+n}:localhost:{5900+n} {user}@{server}
	---

Replace __''{user}''__ with your user account name on the TurboVNC server and
__''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that server.  Replace
__''n''__ with the X display number of the TurboVNC session to which you want
to connect.

For instance, if you wish to connect to display '':1'' on server ''my_server''
using user account ''my_user'', you would type:

	Linux/Mac/Solaris clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	ssh -L 5901:localhost:5901 my_user@my_server
	---

	Windows clients :: {:}
	#Verb: <<---
	"c:\program files\turbovnc\putty" -L 5901:localhost:5901 my_user@my_server
	---

After the SSh connection has been established, you can then launch the
TurboVNC viewer and point it to ''localhost:''__''{n}''__ (''localhost:1'' in the
above example.)

*** Performance Notes
#OPT: noList! plain!

For LAN connections and other high-speed networks, tunneling the TurboVNC
connection over SSh will reduce performance by as much as 20-40%.  For
wide-area networks, however, there is no performance penalty for using SSh
tunneling with TurboVNC.
