* Multithreading in TurboVNC

The TurboVNC Server can use multiple threads to perform image encoding and
compression, thus allowing it to take advantage of multi-core or
multi-processor systems.  The server splits the screen vertically into N tiles,
where N is the number of threads, and assigns each tile to a separate thread.
The scalability of this algorithm is nearly linear when used with demanding 3D
or video applications that fill most of the screen.  However, whether or not
multithreading improves the overall performance of TurboVNC depends largely on
the performance of the client and the network.  If either the client or the
network are the primary performance bottlenecks, then multithreading the server
will not help.  It will almost certainly have no effect on networks slower than
100 Megabit Ethernet or when using the Java TurboVNC Viewer.

To enable server-side multithreading, set the ''TVNC_MT'' environment variable
to ''1'' on the server prior to starting ''vncserver''.  The default behavior
is to use as many threads as there are cores on the server machine, but you can
set the ''TVNC_NTHREADS'' environment variable to override this.
