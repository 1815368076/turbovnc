* TurboVNC Authentication Extensions

The TurboVNC Server supports four "authentication methods", which are used to
validate authentication credentials sent from a VNC viewer:

	No Authentication :: {:}
		Any viewer may connect without sending any authentication credentials.

	VNC Password Authentication :: {:}
		A valid VNC password must be sent from the VNC viewer using the "VNC"
		authentication capability (see below) before it is allowed to connect.  The
		VNC password is typically stored in a file under the user's home directory
		on the server machine.  It is separate from any other login credentials and
		thus represents less of a security threat if compromised (that is, assuming
		the VNC password and the Unix login password are not set to the same
		value.)

	One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication :: {:}
		Using ''vncpasswd'', a unique password is generated "on the fly" for the
		TurboVNC session and is printed on the server's command line (see the man
		page for ''vncpasswd'' for more details.)  The user enters this password in
		the VNC viewer as if it were a VNC password, and the viewer sends the
		OTP using the "VNC" authentication capability (see below.)  However, once
		the OTP has been used once to authenticate a viewer, it is forgotten and
		cannot be reused.  OTP authentication can be used, for instance, to launch
		or connect to TurboVNC sessions from an automated web portal or from a job
		scheduler.  OTP authentication is also useful for allowing temporary access
		to a TurboVNC session for collaboration purposes.

	PAM User/Password Authentication :: {:}
		The TurboVNC Server uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to validate
		a user and password received from a VNC viewer via the "Unix login"
		authentication capability (see below.)  The username and password received
		from the VNC viewer need not necessarily be validated against Unix login
		credentials.  Generally, the server can be configured to use any
		user/password authentication credentials that can be accessed through PAM.
		Since the "Unix login" authentication capability sends the password as
		plain text, it is strongly recommended that this authentication method be
		enabled only if the server is restricted to only allow loopback (SSH)
		connections and to disallow reverse connections (see
		{ref prefix="Section ": Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}.)

The TurboVNC Viewer supports three "authentication capabilities", which are
protocols used to validate authentication credentials with a VNC server:

	None :: {:}
		No authentication credentials are sent to the server.

	VNC Authentication :: {:}
		The VNC password is sent to the server using a DES-encrypted
		challenge-response scheme.  The password can be up to 8 characters long,
		so the DES key length is 56 bits.  This is not a particularly strong form
		of encryption by today's standards (56-bit DES was broken by brute force
		attack in the late 90's.)

	Unix Login Authentication :: {:}
		Both the user name and password are sent to the server as plain text.
		Thus, it is __strongly__ recommended that this authentication capability
		be used only with an SSH-encrypted TurboVNC connection (see
		{ref prefix="Section ": Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}.)

** Enabling Authentication Methods

The default behavior of the TurboVNC Server is for all authentication methods
to be enabled and for VNC password authentication to be preferred over PAM
user/password authentication.  However, the system administrator can disable
one or more of the authentication methods or set the preferred order of the
authentication methods by editing the server's authentication configuration
file.  See the ''Xvnc'' man page for more details.

If both PAM user/password authentication and VNC password authentication are
enabled on the server, then the user can force the use of Unix login
authentication in the TurboVNC Viewer by passing an argument of
''-user ''__''{user_name}''__ to ''vncviewer'' when connecting to the TurboVNC
session.  Similarly, the user can force the use of VNC authentication by
passing an argument of ''-nounixlogin'' to ''vncviewer'' when connecting to the
TurboVNC session.  Both of these command-line options work with both the Unix
and Windows versions of ''vncviewer''.

If the system administrator has not restricted any of the authentication
methods on a system-wide basis, then the user can choose to disable some or
all of them for a single TurboVNC session by passing command-line arguments to
''vncserver''.  See the ''vncserver'' man page for more details.
