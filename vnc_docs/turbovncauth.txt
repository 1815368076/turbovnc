* TurboVNC Authentication Extensions

The TurboVNC Server supports four methods for authenticating VNC viewers:

	No Authentication :: {:}
		Any viewer may connect without entering a password.

	VNC Password Authentication :: {:}
		A VNC password must be entered in order to connect.  The VNC password is
		typically stored in a file under the user's home directory on the server
		machine.  It is separate from any other login credentials and thus
		represents less of a security threat if compromised (that is, assuming the
		VNC password and the Unix login password are not set to the same value.)

	One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication :: {:}
		A unique password is generated "on the fly" for the TurboVNC session and is
		passed to the user via SSH.  Once the password has been used once to
		authenticate with the TurboVNC session, the password is forgotten and
		cannot be reused.  OTP authentication can be used, for instance, to launch
		or connect to TurboVNC sessions from an automated web portal or from a job
		scheduler.  OTP authentication is also useful for allowing temporary access
		to a TurboVNC session for collaboration purposes.

	PAM User/Password Authentication :: {:}
		The TurboVNC Server uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to validate
		a user and password sent from the VNC viewer.  This authentication method
		is used to implement the "Unix login authentication" extension to the VNC
		protocol, but the username and password received from the VNC viewer need
		not necessarily be validated against Unix login credentials.  Generally,
		the server can be configured to use any user/password authentication
		credentials that can be accessed through PAM.  It is
		__strongly__ recommended that the PAM user/password authentication method
		be used only with an SSH-encrypted TurboVNC connection (see
		{ref prefix="Section ": Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}), since the Unix login
		authentication extension to VNC sends the Unix password in plain text over
		the network.

** Enabling Authentication Methods

The default behavior of the TurboVNC Server is for all authentication methods
to be enabled and for VNC password authentication to be preferred over PAM
user/password authentication.  However, the system administrator can disable
one or more of the authentication methods or set PAM user/password
authentication to be preferred over VNC password authentication by editing the
server's authentication configuration file.  See the ''Xvnc'' man page for more
details.

If both PAM user/password authentication and VNC password authentication are
enabled on the server, then the user can force the use of Unix login
authentication in the TurboVNC Viewer by passing an argument of
''-user ''__''{user_name}''__ to ''vncviewer'' when connecting to the TurboVNC
session.  Similarly, the user can force the use of VNC password (or OTP)
authentication by passing an argument of ''-nounixlogin'' to ''vncviewer'' when
connecting to the TurboVNC session.  Both of these command-line options work
with both the Unix and Windows versions of ''vncviewer''.

If the system administrator has not restricted any of the authentication
methods on a system-wide basis, then the user can choose to disable some or
all of them for a single TurboVNC session by passing command-line arguments to
''vncserver''.  See the ''vncserver'' man page for more details.
