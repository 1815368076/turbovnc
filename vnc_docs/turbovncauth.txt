* TurboVNC Authentication Extensions

The TurboVNC server supports four methods for authenticating VNC viewers:

	No Authentication :: {:}
		Any viewer may connect without entering a password.

	VNC Password Authentication :: {:}
		A VNC password must be entered in order to connect.  The VNC password is
		typically stored in a file under the user's home directory on the server
		machine.  It is separate from any other login credentials and thus
		represents less of a security threat if compromised (that is, assuming the
		VNC password and the Unix login password are not set to the same value.)

	One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication :: {:}
		A unique password is generated "on the fly" for the TurboVNC session and is
		passed to the user via SSH.  Once the password has been used once to
		authenticate with the TurboVNC session, the password is forgotten and
		cannot be reused.  OTP authentication can be used, for instance, to launch
		or connect to TurboVNC sessions from an automated web portal or from a job
		scheduler.  OTP authentication is also useful for allowing temporary access
		to a TurboVNC session for collaboration purposes.

	PAM User/Password Authentication :: {:}
		The TurboVNC server uses Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) to validate
		a user and password sent from the VNC viewer.  This authentication method
		is used to implement the "Unix login authentication"
		extension to the TightVNC protocol, but the username and password
		received from the VNC viewer need not necessarily be validated against
		Unix login credentials.  Generally, any user/password authentication
		credentials that can be accessed through PAM can be used.  It is
		__strongly__ recommended that the PAM user/password authentication method
		be used only with an SSH-encrypted TurboVNC connection (see
		{ref prefix="Section ": Secure_TurboVNC_Usage}), since Unix login
		authentication sends the Unix password in plain text over the network.

** Enabling Authentication Methods

The default behavior of the TurboVNC server is for all authentication methods
to be enabled and for VNC password authentication to be preferred over Unix
login authentication.  However, the system administrator can disable one or
more of the authentication methods or set Unix login authentication to be
preferred over VNC password authentication by editing the server's
authentication configuration file.  See the ''Xvnc'' man page for more details.

If both Unix login authentication and VNC password authentication are enabled
on the server, then the user can force the use of Unix login authentication by
passing an argument of ''-user ''__''{user_name}''__ to ''vncviewer'' when
connecting to the TurboVNC session.  Similarly, the user can force the use of
VNC password (or OTP) authentication by passing an argument of ''-nounixlogin''
to ''vncviewer'' when connecting to the TurboVNC session.  Both of these
command-line options work with both the Unix and Windows versions of
''vncviewer''.

If the system administrator has not restricted any of the authentication
methods on a system-wide basis, then the user can choose to disable some or
all of them for a single TurboVNC session by passing command-line arguments to
''vncserver''.  See the ''vncserver'' man page for more details.

** Configuring PAM User/Password Authentication

The ''Xvnc'' man page contains information about configuring PAM user/password
authentication.  In some cases, it may be necessary to make the ''Xvnc''
binary setuid root in order for PAM user/password authentication to work.  This
is known to be necessary on Solaris 10, for instance.
