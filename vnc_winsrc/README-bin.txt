TurboVNC 0.5.1 Binary Distribution for Windows platforms
========================================================

TurboVNC is a highly-optimized version of TightVNC 1.3 designed for real-time
video applications (specifically VirtualGL, which performs real-time 3D
rendering on a dedicated server and outputs the results as an interactive video
stream.)  TurboVNC uses a more simplified version of tight encoding than
TightVNC and accelerates the JPEG encoding portion of the tight codec with
TurboJPEG, the same high-speed JPEG codec used by VirtualGL.  These
optimizations improve TurboVNC's performance relative to TightVNC by over an
order of magnitude in most cases, and they allow TurboVNC to compress the
images generated by 3D apps more efficiently than TightVNC.  However, the
trade-off is that TightVNC will generally compress 2D application workloads
more efficiently (albeit more slowly.)

In addition to an optimized codec, TurboVNC also adds double buffering support
to the client as well as minor protocol tweaks which allow interactive
performance over broadband without breaking compatibility with TightVNC.
TurboVNC is currently the best performing solution for enabling the use of
VirtualGL on all types of networks.  TurboVNC is also easier to deploy than
the VirtualGL Client, since it does not require an X server to be running on
the client machine.  TurboVNC also provides rudimentary collaboration
capabilities.

TurboVNC can be used as a more general-purpose remote access solution for 2D
applications, and in particular it is a good choice for applications that
require high performance with high image quality.
