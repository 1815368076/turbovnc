Building TurboVNC for Windows
=============================

Build Environment:

-- Gnu Make v3.7 or later
   This can be found in the MSYS package (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml)
   or in Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later
   Tested with the free Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

-- Microsoft Platform SDK
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

   The Platform SDK include and library paths must be added to the system or
   user INCLUDE and LIB environment variables (respectively.)

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TurboVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

   Recommended:
-- Intel Integrated Performance Primitives v4.1 or later
   TurboVNC can be built with 100% open source technology using a version of
   libjpeg v6b.  This will produce correct, albeit slow, behavior.  In order to
   get optimal performance out of TurboVNC, however, it is necessary to build
   TurboVNC against the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives, which are
   capable of compressing JPEG images 3-4x faster than libjpeg.

   Single developer licenses for IPP can be obtained directly from Intel:
   http://www.intel.com/software/products/ipp/index.htm

   Licenses are free for non-commercial use and inexpensive for commercial use.
   The IPP license entitles the license holder to distribute any binaries built
   with the IPP freely and without royalties.

   The IPP include and library paths must be added to the system or user
   INCLUDE and LIB environment variables (respectively.)

   The TurboVNC build defaults to using IPP.  If you wish to build TurboVNC
   against libjpeg instead, add an argument of JPEGLIB=libjpeg to make:

     make JPEGLIB=libjpeg


Library Dependencies in the VirtualGL Source Tree:

TurboVNC depends on TurboJPEG and FBX, two libraries in the VirtualGL source
tree.  The TurboVNC build environment expects the VirtualGL source tree to be
located one level up from the top of the TurboVNC source tree, e.g.:

   vgl/
   vnc/
     vnc_winsrc/
       vncviewer/
       winvnc/

TurboVNC's Makefile will attempt to build the necessary dependency libraries
in the vgl directory prior to building TurboVNC.


Building TurboVNC:

If everything is set up properly, you should be able to:

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make


Packaging TurboVNC:

Make sure that compil32.exe (the Inno Setup Compiler) is in your path, then

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make dist

The installer package will be named "TurboVNC.exe", and it can be found in
vnc/vnc_winsrc/.
