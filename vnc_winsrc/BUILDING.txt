Building TurboVNC for Windows
=============================

Build Environment:

-- Gnu Make v3.7 or later
   This can be found in the MSYS package (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml)
   or in Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later
   Tested with the free Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition --
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

-- Microsoft Platform SDK
   Find the "SDK Downloads" link at http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TurboVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

   Recommended:
-- Intel Integrated Performance Primitives v4.1 or later
   TurboVNC can be built with a completely free version of libjpeg v6b which
   will produce correct, albeit slow, behavior.  In order to get optimal
   performance out of TurboVNC, however, it is necessary to build TurboVNC
   against the Intel Performance Primitives, which are capable of compressing
   JPEG images 3-4x faster than libjpeg.

   IPP can be downloaded for free for non-commercial purposes or for internal
   evaluation:
   http://www3.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/perflib/ipp/219858.htm
   Licenses which allow for commercial use and royalty-free distribution are
   available at a reasonable cost:
   http://www.intel.com/cd/software/products/asmo-na/eng/238658.htm

   The TurboVNC build defaults to using IPP and assumes that the IPP include
   and library paths have been added to the system INCLUDE and LIB environment
   variables.  If you wish to build TurboVNC with libjpeg instead, add an
   argument of JPEGLIB=libjpeg to make:

     make JPEGLIB=libjpeg


Library Dependencies in the VirtualGL Source Tree:

TurboVNC depends on TurboJPEG and FBX, two libraries in the VirtualGL source
tree.  The TurboVNC build environment expects the VirtualGL source tree to be
located one level up from the top of the TurboVNC source tree, e.g.:

   vgl/
   vnc/
     vnc_winsrc/
       vncviewer/
       winvnc/

TurboVNC's Makefile will attempt to build the necessary dependency libraries
in the vgl directory prior to building TurboVNC.


Building TurboVNC:

If everything is set up properly, you should be able to:

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make


Packaging TurboVNC:

Make sure that compil32.exe (the Inno Setup Compiler) is in your path, then

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make dist

The installer package will be named "TurboVNC.exe", and it can be found in
vnc/vnc_winsrc/.
