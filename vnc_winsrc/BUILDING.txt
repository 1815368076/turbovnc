Building TurboVNC for Windows
=============================


Build Environment:
------------------

-- GNU Make v3.7 or later

   GNU Make for Win32 can be found in MSYS
   (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml) or Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later

   If you don't already have Visual C++, then the easiest way to get it is by
   installing the Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5
   (or a later version):

   http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd146047.aspx

   The Windows SDK includes both 32-bit and 64-bit Visual C++ compilers and
   everything necessary to build TurboVNC.

   * For 32-bit builds, you can also use Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express
     Edition (or a later version.)  Visual C++ Express Edition is a free
     download.
   * Add the compiler and SDK binary directories (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN[\amd64];
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE;
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\bin[\x64])
     to the system or user PATH environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.
   * Add the compiler and SDK include directories (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\INCLUDE;
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\include)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.
   * Add the compiler and SDK library directories (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\LIB[\amd64];
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\lib[\x64])
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TurboVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php.
   You also need the Inno Setup Preprocessor, which is available in the
   Inno Setup QuickStart Pack.

   Add the directory containing iscc.exe (for instance, 
   C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5) to the system or user PATH environment
   variable prior to building TurboVNC.

-- libjpeg-turbo SDK for Visual C++

   * The libjpeg-turbo SDK Windows installer (EXE) can be obtained from the
     "Files" area of:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo

   * Add the libjpeg-turbo include path (c:\libjpeg-turbo[64]\include) to the
     system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building TurboVNC.
   * Add the libjpeg-turbo library path (c:\libjpeg-turbo[64]\lib) to the
     system or user LIB environment variable prior to building TurboVNC.


Building TurboVNC:
------------------

If everything is set up properly, then you should be able to:

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make

The default on 64-bit Windows platforms is to build a 64-bit version of
TurboVNC.  To build a 32-bit version of TurboVNC on a 64-bit Windows system,
pass an argument of

  WIN64=no

to make.


Packaging TurboVNC:
-------------------

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make dist

The installer package will be named "TurboVNC-{version}.exe" (32-bit) or
"TurboVNC64-{version}.exe", and it can be found in windows/ (32-bit) or
windows64/ (64-bit).
