Building TurboVNC for Windows
=============================

Build Environment:

-- Gnu Make v3.7 or later
   This can be found in the MSYS package (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml)
   or in Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later
   Tested with the free Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

-- Microsoft Platform SDK
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/

   The Platform SDK include and library paths must be added to the system or
   user INCLUDE and LIB environment variables (respectively.)

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TurboVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

-- TurboJPEG SDK
   * Available from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509
   * Add the TurboJPEG include directory (e.g. c:\turbojpeg\include) to your
     system INCLUDE environment variable
   * Add the TurboJPEG lib directory (e.g. c:\turbojpeg\lib) to your
     system LIB environment variable

Building TurboVNC:

If everything is set up properly, you should be able to:

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make


Packaging TurboVNC:

Make sure that compil32.exe (the Inno Setup Compiler) is in your path, then

  cd vnc/vnc_winsrc
  make dist

The installer package will be named "TurboVNC.exe", and it can be found in
vnc/vnc_winsrc/.
