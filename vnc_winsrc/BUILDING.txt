Building TurboVNC for Windows
=============================

Build Environment:

-- GNU Make v3.7 or later

   GNU Make for Win32 can be found in MSYS
   (http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml) or Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/)

-- Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 or later

   * Tested with Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition and
     Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (both free downloads):

     http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/

   * Add the compiler binary directories (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN;
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE)
     to the system or user PATH environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.
   * Add the compiler include directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\INCLUDE)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.
   * Add the compiler library directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\LIB)
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.

-- Microsoft Windows SDK

   * This is included with Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition, but users
     of prior editions of Visual C++ can download the SDK from:

     http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb980924.aspx

   * Add the SDK include directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\include)
     to the system or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.
   * Add the SDK library directory (for instance,
     c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\lib)
     to the system or user LIB environment variable prior to building
     TurboVNC.

-- Inno Setup (needed to build the TurboVNC installer)
   Inno Setup can be downloaded from http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php

   Add the directory containing iscc.exe (for instance, 
   C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 5) to the system or user PATH environment
   variable prior to building TurboVNC.

-- TurboJPEG SDK

   * The TurboJPEG SDK Windows installer (EXE) can be obtained from the
     "Download" area of:

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl

     The direct link for TurboJPEG downloads is:

     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509&package_id=166100

   * Add the TurboJPEG include path (c:\turbojpeg\include) to the system
     or user INCLUDE environment variable prior to building TurboVNC.
   * Add the TurboJPEG library path (c:\turbojpeg\lib) to the system
     or user LIB environment variable prior to building TurboVNC.
