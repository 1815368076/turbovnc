# The VNCSERVERS variable is a list of display:user pairs, separated by
# spaces.

# Uncomment the line below to start a VNC server on display :1 as 'myusername'
# (adjust this to your own user name).  You will also need to configure a VNC
# password (run 'man -M /opt/TurboVNC/man vncpasswd' for instructions on how
# to set this) or another form of authentication.  See the TurboVNC User's
# Guide for more information about the authentication methods available in 
# TurboVNC.
#
# DO NOT RUN THIS SERVICE if your local area network is untrusted!  See the
# TurboVNC User's Guide for information about tunneling TurboVNC over SSH.
