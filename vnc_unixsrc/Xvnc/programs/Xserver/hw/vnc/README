This is the directory containing the code specific to the VNC X server.
Note that within this directory the name RFB is still used instead of VNC.

NOTE:

This version of TurboVNC contains code from the xf4vnc project
(http://xf4vnc.sourceforge.net) by Alan Hourihane <alanh@fairlite.demon.co.uk>.
Mostly, we merged only the code that was necessary to implement the X Rendering
Extension, but this involved some systemic changes, such as replacing cfb and
mfb with fb and modifying mi where necessary to support fb.  We also merged in
any minor fixes, such as compiler warning elimination, formatting improvements,
safety checks, etc. that had no risk of destabilization.  The render/ and fb/
directories are mostly copied verbatim from xf4vnc, whereas the other code
borrows from xf4vnc only where it needs to.
