Description: An accelerated version of TightVNC designed for video and 3D applications
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which
 allows you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the
 machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and
 from a wide variety of machine architectures.  TurboVNC is a sleek and
 fast VNC distribution, containing a high-performance implementation of
 Tight encoding designed to work in conjunction with VirtualGL.
