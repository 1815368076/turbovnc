Description: A highly-optimized version of VNC that can be used with real-time video applications
 Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which
 allows you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the
 machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and
 from a wide variety of machine architectures.  TurboVNC is a sleek and
 fast VNC distribution, containing a high-performance implementation of
 Tight encoding designed to work in conjunction with VirtualGL.
