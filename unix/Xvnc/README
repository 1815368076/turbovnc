Xvnc - the VNC X server
=======================

This is the top-level directory for Xvnc, the VNC X server (or the X VNC
server, depending on how you look at it.)

TurboVNC's implementation of Xvnc is built upon the X.org 7.7 code base.  The
VNC server portion of the code was originally based on TightVNC 1.3.x, but
the current version also borrows code and/or algorithms from other VNC
implementations (including xf4vnc and TigerVNC) and contains a great deal of
original code.

The code specific to TurboVNC is located in the programs/Xserver/hw/vnc
directory.  The rest of the code is a stripped-down version of Xorg, including
only the features necessary to support Xvnc.

Configurable Authentication
---------------------------
This version of Xvnc incorporates code that allows different authentication
methods to be selected at run time.  This code supports the standard
"No Authentication" and "VNC Password" authentication methods as well as
methods for using one-time passwords (OTP) and Pluggable Authentication Modules
(PAM).

The Xvnc server will look in the security configuration file (default
"/etc/turbovncserver-security.conf") at run time for security configuration
directives.

To enable PAM support (required for the "PAM User/Password" authentication
method), the TVNC_USEPAM CMake variable must be enabled.  This is the default
for Linux.  To enable or disable PAM support, pass -DTVNC_USEPAM=1 or
-DTVNC_USEPAM=0 to cmake when configuring the build.

The pam-userpwd authentication method requires the TurboVNC Viewer or another
VNC viewer that can handle the Tight security type and the Unix Login
authentication scheme.  You will also need to configure PAM as appropriate
for your system.  The default PAM service name is "turbovnc".

NOTE: interaction with PAM is limited to supplying a user name and password.
The exchange of any additional information is not supported.

See the Xvnc man page for details on the command-line options that control
configurable authentication.
