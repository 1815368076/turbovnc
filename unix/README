TurboVNC Source distribution for Unix platforms
===============================================

This distribution is based on the standard VNC source and includes new
TurboVNC-specific features and fixes, such as additional low-bandwidth
optimizations, major GUI improvements, and more.

There are six programs here:

    Xvnc - the TurboVNC Server for Unix.  Xvnc is both a VNC server and an X
           server with a "virtual" framebuffer.  You should normally use the
           vncserver script to start Xvnc.

    vncserver - This is a wrapper script that makes starting Xvnc more
                convenient.  vncserver requires Perl.

    vncpasswd - a program that allows you to change the VNC password used to
                access your VNC server sessions (assuming VNC authentication is
                being used.)  The vncserver script will automatically launch
                this program if it detects that VNC authentication is in use
                and a VNC password has not yet been configured.

    vncviewer - This is the VNC viewer, or client, program for the X Window
                System.  vncviewer connects to a VNC server and allows you to
                interact with the remote desktop being displayed by the VNC
                server.

    vncconnect - Normally, vncviewer connects to Xvnc, but you can use this
                 program to initiate a "reverse connection", whereby Xvnc
                 connects to an instance of vncviewer that has been started in
                 "listen mode."

    tvncconfig - a helper program that runs in the VNC server session and
                 handles the transfer of clipboard data between the VNC server
                 and X applications.

See BUILDING.txt for instructions on how to build these programs.
